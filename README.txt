* Description: Simulation of a self driving car. The user can switch between a computer and themself using the wasd keys.
"Traits" for the car simulation can be randomized, or be a set that works for must of the track.

* 3rd party assets (EasySuspensionÅfs Script and HibbyGameÅfs car model) were free assets from the store, 
they are in their respective folders. 

*Everything outside of those two folders was created by me with the exception of the CarController script, 
which started out as a RearWheel drive script but has been heavily modified.

*The video demo isnÅft hosted on vimeo and instead is just a local file included with the project. The video demos the simulation
with manual drive and randomized traits turned off.

*IÅfm quite unhappy where this project ended, as I ran out of time. IÅfd like to continue working on the project 
until all my goals for the project are achieved. I'd like to fully implement a genetic algorithm system, and add a few more 
traits in regards to the sensors, like length and the amount of sensors.
